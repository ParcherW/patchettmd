create_random_atoms
We need a python function called create_random_atoms to address issue #4 in github. The function should create an arbitrarily specified number of atoms to be initialized. The best way to do this John can think of is to create a funtion that returns a list of Atoms that takes:
1. The number of atoms required in the list, defaults to 1.
2. A random number seed that defaults to 1
3. atom_type that defaults to 0
4. mass that defaults to 1.0
5. A six tuple representing xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax that represents a box thatthe position should fall within
6. The maximum absolute of velocity defaulting to 3

The Atom class consructor definition follows:
class Atom:
    def __init__(self, position, velocity, atom_type=0, mass=1.0):
The postion and velocity are both 3 vectors and can be represented as lists or tuples or numpy arrays as they will be cast to numpy arrays in the constructor.

Can you create this function? Pleae don't provide the Atom class or a main, just the funtion.
